# STOMT Discord Bot

![Sync Votes Example](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/stomt/stomt-discord-bot/master/docu/discord-stomt-vote-sync.png)

This bot syncs [Discord](https://discordapp.com/) servers (guilds) with [STOMT](https://www.stomt.com/). It talks to the [STOMT API](https://rest.stomt.com/) to allow users interact with STOMT from inside Discord.

## Current Features

- *Vote Stomts:* User can vote Stomt links posted in Discord using reactions.
- *Apply First Votes:* The bot votes Stomt links itself, so users just have to click on the reactions instead of searching for the right one.
- *Publish Stomts:* Admins can add Webhooks to automatically post all new Stomt they recieve in Discord. [Learn More!](https://www.stomt.com/integrations/discord)
